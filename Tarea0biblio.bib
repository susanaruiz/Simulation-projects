abstract = {Cutting and packing problems appear under various names in literature, e.g. cutting stock or trim loss problem, bin or strip packing problem, vehicle, pallet or container loading problem, nesting problem, knapsack problem etc. The paper develops a consistent and systematic approach for a comprehensive typology integrating the various kinds of problems. The typology is founded on the basic logical structure of cutting and packing problems. The purpose is to unify the different use of notions in the literature and to concentrate further research on special types of problems. {\textcopyright} 1990.},
